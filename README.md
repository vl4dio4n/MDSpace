## App Description and Features

allFriends is a video conferencing and chatting application designed to allow users easily create a free account and start conversations with other peers via messages or video calls. Converstions are of two types, p2p or group. However, regardless of their type, they can be splitted in any number of threads in order to help users beeter organise the messaged based on the topic. In p2p chats, any party is allowed to create communication threads. On the other hand, in group converstions, only users with admin role have this privilege. Any app user, can create groups and add members to them, implicitly having a role of admin (group roles are granted by group's admins). Moreover, in any p2p or group chat there is the possibility to make video calls, which are private to that communication channel, meaning that users from other conversations can't join them. Despite that, the app is still awesome.

## Technologies
